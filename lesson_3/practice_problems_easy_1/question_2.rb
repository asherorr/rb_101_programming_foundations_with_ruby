# Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

#     1. what is != and where should you use it?
#     2. put ! before something, like !user_name
#     3. put ! after something, like words.uniq!
#     4. put ? before something
#     5. put ? after something
#     6. put !! before something, like !!user_name

#Note: If you see ! or ? at the end of the method, it's actually part of the method name, and not Ruby syntax.

#1. != is the "not equal to" operator. You would use it to evaluate whether or not two expressions are equivalent.

#4. ? is the ternary operator for if else.

#6. !!<object> is used to turn any object into the opposite of their Boolean equivalent.
